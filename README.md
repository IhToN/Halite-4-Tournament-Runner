# Halite 4 Tournament Runner

This code allows you to run a local tournament ranking bots you provide by the Trueskill or ELO ranking algorithm (somewhat similar to the current Kaggle leaderboard ranking system)

Ensure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) version 12.x or above installed

To run the tournament, fork this repo or clone it to your computer, and first install the [Dimensions](https://github.com/stonet2000/dimensions) package
```
npm install dimensions-ai
```
then run
```
node run.js
```

to see a live display of a leaderboard of 4 bots. The sample bots used here for demonstration are the swarm bot by Yegor Biryukov: https://www.kaggle.com/yegorbiryukov/halite-swarm-intelligence, the getting started bot provided by Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/getting-started-with-halite, and a bot that does nothing called stillbot.

To add more bots, add them to the list in `run.js` at line 47. Note that you have to pass in paths to a file (so you can't use the Kaggle given random bot, you will have to copy it over yourself)

To use ELO ranking instead of trueskill (the default), change line 58 in `run.js` to `Tournament.RANK_SYSTEM.ELO`

This will also automatically generate log files that record all output to standard error only. To turn this off, change line 63 in `run.js` to `false`.

### Notes

The file `run.sh` has the script that is used to run the matches in the tournament

Unfortunately, Windows doesn't work, you will need WSL
